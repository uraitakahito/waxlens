/**
 * The vocabulary tests are filtered by, in one place.
 *
 * Shared rather than declared in the root config, because there are two ways
 * to run these tests and only one of them sees the root. `pnpm test:ui` goes
 * through `vitest.config.ts` and its `projects`; `pnpm test` is `pnpm -r test`,
 * which runs each package through its own config and never loads the root at
 * all. `strictTags` is on by default, so a vocabulary the per-package configs
 * cannot see stops those runs before a single test executes — which is the CI
 * path (`pnpm --filter @waxlens/core check`).
 *
 * No `timeout` or `retry` on any of these, which is half of what Vitest's tags
 * are for. The whole suite is ~200 tests in 3.5s, so no class of test here
 * wants a different execution policy. What these buy is being able to ask
 * "which tests cover this concern?" — a question neither file names nor
 * directories answer, because concerns overlap and the file naming does not
 * agree with itself (`frictionless-schema.test.ts` sits beside
 * `datapackage-frictionless-structure.test.ts`).
 *
 * Deliberately not one tag per rule. Of 22 rules only 5 have a test file named
 * after them; the rest are covered inside `validate.test.ts` and the corpus
 * suite, so a rule-level vocabulary would be 17 names with nothing behind them.
