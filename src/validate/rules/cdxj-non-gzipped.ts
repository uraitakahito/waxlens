/**
 * Rule: cdxj/index-not-gzipped
 *
 * Producer-strict variant of the wabac-recognition contract: when the
 * producer is expected to emit a plain `indexes/index.cdxj`, this rule
 * surfaces any `.cdxj.gz` / `.cdx.gz` variant (or a `.cdxj` file whose
 * content begins with the gzip magic) as an error.
 *
 * The generic "wabac.js can't load this index" check lives in
 * `cdxj/index-recognised-by-wabac` (Phase D); this rule remains because
 * a producer that emits gzipped CDXJ without a paired `.idx` is broken
 * in the same way regardless — and a producer documented to emit the
 * plain form is doubly broken if it emits the gzipped form instead.
 *
 * Replay engine: wabac.js `multiwacz.ts:loadIndex` accepts `.cdx` /
 *       `.cdxj` directly and `.idx` (with paired `.cdx.gz` via the
 *       `!meta { format: "cdxj-gzip-1.0", filename }` header).
 *       `.cdx.gz` / `.cdxj.gz` ALONE is never accepted.
 * Reference producer: browserhive/src/storage/wacz/packager.ts:46-56
 *       commits to plain `indexes/index.cdxj` and documents the
 *       silent-skip trap that motivates this rule.
 *
 * Detection strategy:
 *   1. If `indexes/index.cdxj.gz` (or any `.cdxj.gz` / `.cdx.gz` variant)
 *      is present, that's the bug — report with the offending entry name.
 *   2. If `indexes/index.cdxj` is present but starts with the gzip magic
 *      bytes (`1f 8b`), the file was double-handled (named correctly but
 *      gzipped content). Also a producer bug.
